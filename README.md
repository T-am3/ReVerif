ReVerif is a web-based tool meant to retrieve of the verification link to verify their age. Unlocking access to features such as voice chat typically restricted to users aged 13 and above on ROBLOX. Along with that removing that pesky safechat that no one likes!

## How It Works

If you're using my backend, it processes your ROBLOXSecurity cookie through my server to generate a verification link from ROBLOX's API. If you do not feel comfortable with that you can [self-host the tool](https://github.com/T-am3/ReVerif-Backend) or use the [NodeJS script](extras/index.js) instead.


## Features

- Retrieve the age verification link for ROBLOX accounts.
- Enable users to verify their age and unlock features restricted to users aged 13 and above.
- Accessible from any web browser, providing convenience to users.
- I don't know, look cool?
